# meta.sh installation

This is the recommended flow for using meta.sh:

- If it doesn't already exist, create your ~/bin directory and make sure that
  ~/bin is exported as part of your `$PATH` on login.
- Download meta.sh using curl or wget into your ~/bin directory.
- Review the downloaded file using `$EDITOR` to make sure that it does what
  meta.sh is supposed to.
- Set the newly-downloaded script as executable.

The commands to do (most) of this are described in the script: you may follow
these by whatever mechanism you choose (by hand, by clipboard) to perform the
installation.
